# Pneumatic Actuation Controller

## Assignment Details

On docs/assignment.pdf a detailed description of the exercise is given.

The objective of this assignment is to test programming capabilites, control theory and simple material knowledge. This will include setting up the soft simulation software on your computer, completing the Python simulation file and giving small descriptions on the given questions.

The result of this exercise will be a zip file with a .txt (template on docs/) containing the best achieved positions together with screenshots for each target where the strain and the coordinate frame of the simulation are **clearly visible**. The zip will also contain the assignment.py and a controller.py where your implementation of a SoftBodyController class shall be present. Finally, plots for the cavity pressure values to reach the target positions shall be included. This zip will be named **lastname.firstname.zip**.

## SOFA Installation

```
OBS!
In order to load the SofaPython3 plugin you need to select the plugin manager in the GUI on the top bar.
A list of plugins should be shown, scroll and select SofaPython3.
You sould then be able to load the assignment.py from the rai-sofa-assignment repository.
```
The installation guide of the simulation tool can be found in the following link [SOFA Framework Releases (v24.12)](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/releases/tag/v24.12.00). The simplest installation is on Windows, but it is also possible to setup on Linux and MacOS (yet requires more knowledge on building software from source).

Once installed, start the simulation tool and select on the GUI top-left menu **File**. Select the *assignment.py* that you have read and completed where necessary. More information can be found on the [SOFA Documentation](https://sofa-framework.github.io/doc/using-sofa/runsofa/).
